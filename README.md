Sales Dashboard – Built Using Microsoft Excel
The Sales Dashboard is a comprehensive and visually engaging analytical tool developed using Microsoft Excel to provide businesses with a clear and concise overview of their sales performance. The dashboard consolidates sales data and presents key metrics such as total sales, total profit, sales trends, regional performance, and product-wise analysis. By using pivot tables, charts, KPIs, and slicers, the dashboard enables users to interactively explore data and make informed, data-driven business decisions.
